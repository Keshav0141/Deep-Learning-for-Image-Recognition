# üñºÔ∏è Deep Learning for Image Recognition

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Deep-Learning-for-Image-Recognition.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to build and train **deep learning models** for **image classification and recognition tasks** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and other deep learning techniques.

## üéØ Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Preprocess and augment image datasets.  
- Design and train deep learning models (CNNs).  
- Evaluate model performance on image classification tasks.  
- Compare results across different architectures.

## üìå Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Image resizing and normalization  
  - Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, shifting)  

- **Model Architectures**  
  - Basic CNN from scratch  
  - Transfer learning with pretrained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, Inception, MobileNet)  
  - Fine-tuning pretrained models for better accuracy  

- **Training Process**  
  - Model compilation with different optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop)  
  - Loss functions for classification (categorical crossentropy / binary crossentropy)  
  - Early stopping and learning rate scheduling  

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Training & validation accuracy and loss plots  
  - Confusion matrix  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - ROC-AUC curve (if applicable)
